Cake Bot 5000
-------------

My instructor at CodePlatoon built a game where Robots Eat cakes!
We interact with this Robot via an api, HTTP requests.

This is my atempt at making a Robot That searches out these cakes
and eats them with very little imput from me.

- The Robot can only move North, South, East, and West
  - You can only give it one movement per request
- The Robot can only eat cake if it's standing on it
- The Robot can only see a grid of 9 points
  - NW, N, NE,
    E,  C, W,
    SW, S, SE

[] Give Robot basic directions
  - Move
  - Eat Cake

[] Robot can eat cake or move toward cake if cake is close

[] Make Robot moves on if no cake near it
  - Randomly
  - Thoughtfully

[] Robot should eat cake when it is standing on it
[] Robot should keep track of where it has been
  - Also where cakes are if close
  - Also where walls are

The Point
---------
To help understand what API's are and how we can interact with them.
ie: Consume information and send information to them.
