Cake Bot 3000 and 5000
-------------

My instructor at CodePlatoon built a game where Robots Eat cakes!
The link is [here](https://github.com/JoshCheek/network_games)
We interact with this Robot via an api.

- The Robot can only move North, South, East, and West
  - You can only give it one movement per request
- The Robot can only eat cake if it's standing on it
- The Robot can only see a grid of 9 points
  - NW, N, NE,
    E,  C, W,
    SW, S, SE

Cake Bot 3000
-------------
This Robot takes it's directions directly from me.

- [x] Be able to tell the api to move my robot up, down, left, right
- [x] Robot tells me what is around it
- [x] Be able to turn Robot Off

Cake Bot 5000
-------------
This Robot searches out cakes and eats them
with very little imput from me.

- [x] Give Robot ability to do basic things
  - Move
  - Eat Cake

- [x] Robot should eat cake when it is standing on it
- [x] Robot moves toward cake if cake is nearby

- Robot moves on if no cake near it
  - [x] Randomly
  - [x] Robot should not walk into a wall
  - [ ] Thoughtfully


The Point
---------
To help understand what API's are and how we can interact with them.
ie: Consume information and send information to them.
